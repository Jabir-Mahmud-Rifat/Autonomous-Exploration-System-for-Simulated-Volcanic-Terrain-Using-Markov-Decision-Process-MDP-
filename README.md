## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project aims to design an autonomous exploration system using a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** to navigate a simulated volcanic terrain while managing uncertain environmental conditions such as **lava flows, craters, and gas emissions**. The system optimizes exploration efficiency while ensuring the safety of the agent by balancing risk and reward through probabilistic decision-making.  

By integrating **reinforcement learning** and **uncertainty modeling**, the system adapts dynamically to hazardous conditions, making strategic navigation decisions in real time.  

## ðŸ”§ Features  
- **MDP-Based Decision Making**: Determines optimal exploration strategies.  
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Models environmental hazards dynamically.  
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Improves navigation policies over time.  
- **Safety Optimization**: Ensures risk-aware exploration.  
- **Simulated Environment**: Realistic volcanic terrain with unpredictable hazards.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy, SciPy** (Numerical computations)  
- **OpenAI Gym** (Simulation environment)  
- **Stable Baselines3** (Reinforcement Learning algorithms)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** (For deep reinforcement learning, if needed)
